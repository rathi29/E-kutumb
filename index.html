          <h1>EARLY YEARS</h1>
          <p>Bom in 1898 at Bareli, Ram Kishanji Rathi (RKR) was the eldest sem of Sukh Deoji Rathi. Barel) A presently a small town, aboua 120 kms from: Bhopal on National Highway-12
    
            RKR had 8 siblings, six brothers being Narsingdas. Tulsidas, Prabtailal, Lakharachand & Parshottamde and two sisters Kesar Devi & Chandra Kala
    
            Early yean of RKR were spent between Phalodi & Bamli, until he was married to Sugni Devi, a girl from Bhattar Family of Phalodi. The couple had 8 sons & 3 daughters.
    
            Ho joined father's business of Ghee & Grain. But business did not suit his ethics as it involved speculations. So be decided to jom service in a Marwan group (Bansilal Ahhirchand-HQ at Hinganghat) & tank charge of operations (mainly agriculture) around Vidisha. He shifted family from Bareli to Goberela, a small village near district town Vidisha.
          </p>
    
          <h1>VISION FOR EDUCATION</h1>
    
          Henralized that if family remama in tiny village, education of children would be hadly effected. Thus, family migrated to Vidisha around 1940, a city with rich history & heritage became our home town. (visit http://vidisha nic.in/)
    
          The city was well equipped with secondary level education institution, later an addition of a degree college & an engineering college were added
    
          His vision for education changed the profile of his children (2 son Engineers. 2 Doctors, An advocate & and a daughter imparting education in school). Vidisha soon was reckoned as a center for higher education with in the whole farmily
    
          His vision did not stop at First Generation Today, amongst his 35 grand children, there are 8 bargi neers (2 from III), 5 Technologists including a Ph.D., 4 Physicians & Surgeons & over a dozen Graduates & postgraduates in other streams of education. 3 of his grandchildren & 7 great grand children are in US & Canada. This was the magnitude of vision on education, which changed the profile of generations to come
    
          <h1>IN THE SERVICE OF THE LORD</h1>
    
          He knew only one thing "The God has a plan for my life & that is all I need to know. He told this to us several times in Hindi (sah bhagvat ichha hai)
    
          So, his destination of life was different. He was quite impressed by one of his uncle's (Jugramdasji) devotion towards God & decided to practice a total surrender to God by following Seva path. At itne stage, the support & encouragement given by his wife, was simply outstanding. In fact, in later part of frie we all realized that but for Maa's strong suppert, it would have been very difficult for him to follow Bhakti Marg

          <h1>END</h1>
          <p>His death came to him very peacefully, in fact he was lightly singing Bhajan/gods name even during the last few moments before he left this Materialistic world. Even at the age of 82 he had never been to any chronic Sickness, which definitely made him different from rest of all.

            On 14th of March 1980, he ultimately united with the God, at the age of 82. The end came in early hours (around 4 AM) when some one in the family announced "Bhasa nahi rahe!".
            
            And the person who was in the service of Thakur ji for lasa 25 years was no more with us and so were the early morning chants of his bhajans
            
            The news of his death spread in Vidisha town & soon people in hundreds gathered from all walks of life to pay their tributes
            
            Wife. Sugnidevi, (as we sometimes call her lady with Pentium-V, in a lighter vein,) lived 5 more years and died in 1985. She was true genius with extra ordinary sharp memory.
            
            Lastly we should be very proud of our roots from where we have acquired some of the good genes in us, that is why we also stand outstanding in our respective professions with humanitarian values. We can see that during the era of Shri RKR, on all important occasion of the family not only lineage of Sukdevši but beyond that used to gather and shared joys and sorrows, thereby showing strong bondage of extended family. That is why this occasion is primarily useful in reuniting that scattered bondage.
            
            So, this is all about my maternal grandfather & maa as I knew them.
